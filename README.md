### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Junior in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, majoring in Computer Engineering, focusing on software and web development. I am currently working on my skills for the front end, especially on Angular.

I also have an interest in designing video games, and am hoping to release a presentable demo very soon. Stay tuned!

Feel free to connect me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javierhui "Javier's LinkedIn")!
